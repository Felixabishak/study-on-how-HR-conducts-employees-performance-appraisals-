**INTRODUCTION**

Performance appraisals are a critical activity of Human Resource (HR) management, designed to assess and improve employee performance and promote growth and organizational success. This article explores the formal processes HR uses to carry out effective performance appraisals.

**Setting Clear Objectives**

HR initiates the appraisal process by establishing concise, quantifiable targets for employees. They align the goals with the overall organizational strategy and vision, so employees are aware of their job and expectations.

**Choosing the Correct Appraisal Technique**

-HR uses several appraisal methods depending on organizational needs. The most common ones include:

-360-Degree Feedback: Collects feedback from supervisors, peers, and subordinates.

-Self-Assessments: Asks employees to assess their own performance.

-Rating Scales: Offers ratings for certain traits or skills.

-Management by Objectives (MBO): Concentrates on goal accomplishment.

**Continuous Performance Monitoring**

In order to encourage a proactive culture, HR stresses continuous monitoring through frequent check-ins, one-on-one sessions, and monitoring key performance indicators. This way, any problems can be resolved in a timely manner.

**Conducting Performance Reviews**

-During the formal review process, HR conducts constructive discussions between employees and managers. These reviews include:

-Achievements and contributions.

-Areas for improvement.

-Future goals and expectations.

**Identifying Training and Development Needs**

HR relies on appraisal outcomes to determine gaps in skills and suggest appropriate training programs or workshops. This aids employees in their development and career progression.

**Reward and Recognition**

Excellent performance is rewarded through promotion, bonuses, or incentives. This encourages employees and promotes an excellence culture.

**Documentation and Follow-Up**

HR maintains proper documentation of all appraisal meetings, ratings, and feedback to ensure transparency. Follow-ups are made to implement agreed development plans and goals properly.

**CONCLUSION**

By having organized and transparent systems of appraisals, HR not only assesses performance but also fosters trust and motivation among employees by linking individual growth with organizational goals
